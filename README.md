JWatch v1
===================================================

JWatch v1 is an awesome Java Remote Access Tool that allows you to control a computer and administer it. 

It is not finished, however the main aspects have already been which include File View (still need a file transfer coded), Remote Desktop, Remote Keylogger, and webcam view.

I started this in the summer of 2014 as a side project.

The code base is pure Java, though a few libraries were needed for hardware access using the C language like the JnativeHook for the keylogger.

Feel free to fork and continue further development. Any questions, don't hesitate to ask me. :)

PS: To start the software simply run WindowTester which will pop open a GUI. For localhost testing, run JClient after you run WindowTester. Since you're testing on yourself, your computer currently would essentially be acting as both server and client. Once you run JClient, your computer should then pop up in your WindowTester GUI and you will then be able to select it and do cool things with it!
