JWatch---Revolutionary-Java-Remote-Access-Tool-RAT-
===================================================

JWatch is an awesome Java Remote Access Tool that allows you to control a computer and administer it.

I started this in the summer of 2014 as the other option was to watch movies and waste time. I figured I wanted to do something interesting.

The code base is pure Java, though a few libraries were needed for hardware access using the C language like the JnativeHook for the keylogger.

Feel free to fork and continue further development. Any questions, don't hesitate to ask me. :)
